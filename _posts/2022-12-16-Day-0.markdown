## Day 0?

It's been a long time coming but today is the day I finally decided to start a blog. Why? Well, I come across a lot of random and esoteric things in the world of tech that engage and excite me and I love talking about them! But I also think that often, to truly understand something, you need to be able to explain it to someone else. An old colleague of mine accumulated a set of rules akin to Jethro Gibbs from NCIS during his work, and one of them comes to mind on this topic, which is:

> If they start an explanation with "you just have to..." or "you just need to..." then they often haven't understood the issue at hand.

These phrases are very easy to use but its rarely that simple. Technology is an absolute minefield of complexity and things are rarely "just" that easy. However, I digress. I intend for this blog to be a random set of musings about various Windows, malware, coding, & reverse engineering related things. So if you come across a post that doesn't interest you then please don't shy away as the next blog just might!

Till next time:

WaitForSingleObject(hNextBlog, INFINITE);
