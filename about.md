# Whoami

I'm a security researcher that specialises in Windows!

Security Researcher?

Well, I'm not sure what the appropriate title is, Threat Researcher is perhaps more accurate. The bottom line is, I do:

- Threat Hunting
- Malware Reverse Engineering
- Malware Research
- Malware Sandbox Development
- Coding (primarily C++)
- Infrastructure (only when absolutely necessary)

All with a Windows focus! (I do occasionally touch Linux but Windows is my happy place).

If there's anything else you'd like to know then reach out via email and ask! I'll slowly expand this page with an FAQ section if any questions come my way.
